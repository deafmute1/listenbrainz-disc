## TODO (somewhat ordered by prority)
- Allow setting more than one ViewMode (embed, embedExtended)
- Get youtube links for current track
- Some nice listenbrainz data collage/format commands, get top albums, tracks, genres whatever
  - Server wide stats?
  - Users listen per day
- Get user reccomendations
- Get lyrics for songs (support at _least_ Genius)
- Allow scrobbling (????, would require listenbrainz auth)
  - playback ???
